# Bacteria-detection
Final project of Image processing course (semester 4).

The aim of the project is to automatically segment out bacteria using image processing.

The project's components:

- Primitive graphical interface
- Ability to remove noise using spatial filters
- Ability to apply image transformations (logarithmic and gamma transformation)
- RGB or HSI (HSV) color thresholding
- Ability to remove noise using morphology
- Draw and display detected bacteria outline
- Display statistics about bacteria area (pixel count) as a histogram (x axis - area, y axis bacteria count)
